      "summary": "From an early age I was always interested in understanding how things work, taking them apart and building them up again. This fascination steered me towards studying civil engineering and follow an early career within infrastructure projects.  However, in my roles I was always on the periphery of construction and never got hands on with builds. Having always been interested in the tech world outside of work, I tried a weekend course in front-end web development and found my calling. \n\nI ended up taking the WDI course at GA where I found that web development gave me the perfect blend of building something tangible and being challenged to come up with creative solutions to coding problems. I’m excited by the prospects of being able to apply the skills I’ve learnt at GA in the tech world where I can grow as a developer, build more websites and continue to learn.\n",

        "summary": "In 2017, I completed an intensive bootcamp at General Assembly London where I learnt a range of web development and agile project techniques. Each morning started with daily standups and days regularly involved pair programming, understanding and implementing technical concepts and UX fundamentals. The course also covered a variety of front and back end frameworks and development tools which were put to use in my major portfolio projects:\n\n♣ Project 4: \nhttps://running-trace.herokuapp.com/\nMy final project at General Assembly was to create a full MERN stack application with an open scope to create a RESTful site within a week. The website ended up being a social exercising platform which encourages people to compete and upload the best running traces they’ve saved on the social exercise app, Strava. \n\n♣ Project 3:\nhttps://gigly-wilson.herokuapp.com/\nwhere our product was a social music event app designed for people to create groups attending upcoming gigs. Our application used a MEAN stack and combined three external API’s, pulling event information from Ticketmaster, playing relevant songs from Spotify and displaying the location for each event using Google Maps. \n\n♣ Project 2:\nhttps://katsuper-store.herokuapp.com/\nFor my second major project at GA, I created my first fully RESTful application with backend authentication using Express.js Sessions. This project was my first opportunity to get to grips with an application that demonstrated the create, read update, delete (CRUD) functionality found in most websites.\n\n♣ Project 1:\nhttps://can-you-diglett.herokuapp.com/\nMy first project at GA was to build an interactive game using JavaScript and jQuery for DOM manipulation. This was my first opportunity to apply my early JS knowledge to a working app and to also apply CSS styling to my own product. The overall look and feel of the app was that of a retro 8-bit arcade game with a simple colour scheme and mocked-up game controllers in the user interface.",
